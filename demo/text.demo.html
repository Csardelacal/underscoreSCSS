					A small bit of text that explains what this article is about. You see text like this very often in

					The main text. The idea here is that depending on the context we can add spacers around the headings
					to customize the spacing around them. While this introduces the requirement to have the developer to
					use consistent spacers, the complexity of the CSS is incredibly reduced.

				<p class="text:grey-500">Describe the image here.</p>
				
				<div class="spacer large"></div>
				<p class="fs:5">
					The nice thing here is that the image can be customized by just adding spacers. For this the system allows
					to put a text like the "Describe the image here" above this very close to the image without adding a class
					that indicates the size of margins.
				</p>

				<div class="spacer medium"></div>

				<p class="fs:5">
					We also customized the line height of the p elements to make the text easier on the eyes, since the system 
					font we're currently using is a bit heavy on the eyes.
				</p>

				<div class="spacer medium"></div>

				<p class="fs:3">
					You may also have noticed that using text elements without intrinsic margins or paddings, that we could customize
					the fact that the image above has a bit more space around it. While these paragraphs don't have extra spacing since 
					they don't need it to accommodate the text in the example.

					This mechanism also makes it really simple for full bleed images to be built into the text.
					It's so simple that one could say it's <em>barely an inconvenience.</em> You just have to end
					the container and replace it with a fluid one.

					Again, this is probably far from an ideal situation for scenarios in which the user has to write

					Notice here how we replaced the spacers to make our flow fit better? While the big chonky headings 
					in the h2 and h1 category work really well with a lot of space around them, these small ones do really 
					well without the extra space around them.
				</p>
				
				<div class="spacer medium"></div>

				<p class="font-large">
					This is the reason why we use the spacers. In this scenario, the smaller space works better, but in some
